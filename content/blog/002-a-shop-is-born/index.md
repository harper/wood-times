It would be over 6 months of learning about woodworking and chomping at the bit before I was able to start building out a shop space. My family finally moved into a new house that had an unfinished garage and I had an opportunity to get started.

The space was a small, beautiful blank slate. It would be just enough for what I needed.

There were tall ceilings and copious amounts of wall space, both of which would come in handy.

I knew I needed to get started building out the shop before the garage became a dumping ground for random items from the move that were waiting for a permanent home.

I temporarily suspended my budget and all sense of fiscal responsibility as I bought my first set of tools. I was beginning to suspect this would end up being an expensive hobby. Little did I know.
